/**
 * Authentication handlers authenticate a user in an implementation specific manner. Some examples of this might be by
 * collecting a user name and password and validating it against an LDAP directory, validating a client certificate, or
 * validating one-time password.
 * 
 * When a login handler is invoked the user's {@link edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.idp.session.Session} is bound
 * to the {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession} under the attribute with the name
 * {@link edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.idp.session.Session#HTTP_SESSION_BINDING_ATTRIBUTE}.
 * 
 * After a successful authentication has been completed the handler <strong>MUST</strong> either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bind a {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} to the attribute identified by {@link #SUBJECT_KEY} if one was created
 * during the authentication process. The principals, public, and private credentials from this subject will be merged
 * with those in the {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} within the
 * {@link edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.idp.session.Session}.</li>
 * <li>Bind a {@link java.security.Principal} for the user to the request attribute identified by {@link #PRINCIPAL_KEY}
 * . Such a {@link java.security.Principal} <strong>MUST</strong> implement {@link java.io.Serializable}. This principal
 * will be added to the {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} within the
 * {@link edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.idp.session.Session}.</li>
 * <li>Bind a principal name string to the request attribute identified by {@link AbstractSpringLoginModule#PRINCIPAL_NAME_KEY}. In this case the
 * {@link AuthenticationEngine} will create a {@link java.security.Principal} object of type
 * {@link edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.idp.authn.UsernamePrincipal} and add that to the
 * {@link javax.security.auth.Subject} within the {@link edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.idp.session.Session}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The handler <strong>SHOULD</strong> also:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bind a URI string, representing the authentication method actually used, to a request attribute identified by
 * {@link #AUTHENTICATION_METHOD_KEY}. Failure to do so may lead to a situation where one authentication method is 
 * started but a user switches to a weaker one in mid-process.  Without the login handler explicitly setting the 
 * method, the first method that is started is what will be reported to the relying party.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The handler <strong>MAY</strong> also:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bind an error message, if an error occurred during authentication to the request attribute identified by
 * {@link LoginHandler#AUTHENTICATION_ERROR_KEY}.</li>
 * <li>Bind a {@link AuthenticationException}, if an exception occurred during authentication to the request attribute
 * identified by {@link LoginHandler#AUTHENTICATION_EXCEPTION_KEY}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Finally, the handler must return control to the authentication engine by invoking
 * {@link AuthenticationEngine#returnToAuthenticationEngine(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)}. After which the
 * authentication handler must immediately return.
 * 
 * Handlers <strong>MUST NOT</strong> change or add any data to the user's {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession} that
 * persists past the process of authenticating the user, that is no additional session data may be added and no existing
 * session data may be changed when the handler returns control to the authentication engine.
